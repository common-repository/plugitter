== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Who are all those people in the ranking? I don't know any of them! =

You have to configure the widget with your Twitter Screen Name. If you don't put a Screen Name, *Plugitter* will display a default ranking.

= Ok, I've put my Twitter Screen Name, but the widget doesn't show anything =

The first time *Plugitter* is displayed, it asks our server to build a ranking for you.
Give it five minutes and you have your personalized ranking.

= My followers are all mixed up, can i separate them in categories? =

As a mater of fact, you can.
Just go to our [home page](http://www.datatendencias.com.ar/plugitter) and you will have access to an interface to sort your followers.
Categories you create will be displayed on *Plugitter* automagically.

= Cool! Is there anything else you can do for me? =

If you agree, we can tweet to your followers, like:
`Hey @follower, you are #1 in my ranking! check here http://my.wpblog.com`


= Why on earth I will want to do that? =
